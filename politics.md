## Rules

**Rule 0** *(political conversation)*
While it is not the focus of this space, we here recognize that Queer existence is inherently political. Therefore political topics will be allowed in all conversation spaces with appropriate CWs. These are still sensitive topics and it is important to bring good faith to any discussion that happens. It should be understood that not all disagreements here can be resolved, and that there is a lot of content to cover within differing opinions. At the same time political positions that support any system of oppression are not permitted here. Mods will step in on those topics, non-mods please do not engage with these positions beyond a single gentle reminder.
