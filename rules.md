## Rules

**Rule 0** *(Discord TOS)*

We here are hosted by Discord, and as such all content must fit into their TOS (terms of service). It is not a value statement on the content they forbid, but in order to maintain this space for its core purpose any content deemed to be outside the TOS will be removed without warning. Evaluation of the poster's level of offense will be done on a case by case basis as we do not consider Discord to be always correct here.
A good reading for [Discord alternative options](https://ariadne.space/2023/03/08/help-migrate-a-community-from-discord-to-something-else/) . Supplementing Discord as we have with LinkTree and [the website](https://qcc.straycat.fish) is an option for some types of content.

**Rule 1** *(content warnings)*

As a community focused on consent, we want all our conversations to model that consent culture we dream of. To that end CW (content warnings) must be used in all channels, and `||spoiler tags||` used to allow opt in to the discussion. Threads may also be created with `CW:...` at the beginning of the name to permit conversation within the thread to not use CW or `||` for things that fall under the thread name listed terms. This rule applies to all mediums and links to all mediums.

A non-exhaustive list of topics under this:

- news events, local and otherwise
- phobias
- kinks

Also, the following topics are forbidden in all contexts

- guns

**Rule 2** *(no contempt culture)*

Try and avoid [contempt culture](http://blog.aurynn.com/2015/12/16-contempt-culture). In short contempt culture is showing negative value towards a lack of knowledge, especially seen when such knowledge is considered very common to one side.

**Rule 3** *(read bios)*

It is expected that you will read bios in discord before interacting with folks in a conversation. Names that folks use, their pronouns, community roles; all expected to be found there.

**Rule 4** *(Queer space)*

This space will center Queer voices. One of the ways we will strive to do this is by rules around [CW: Political discussion](/politics/)

## Role Duties

*council*:

is here to be eyes and ears to everything that happens and provide accountability that I am working in a consistent and transparent way. They should also provide opinions they have on the ongoing discussions for how to steer this ship. All of this bounded by each person's energy capacity, with no stated minimum involvement.

*moderator*:

Someone who is regularly available to help interact and shape public conversations here. Be aware of how to interpret the rules and remind folks gently when they step out of line. Escalating to possibly timing folks out temporarily and providing recommendation to the safety team for folks that consistently violate.

*safety team*:

Handle member nomination procedures; making posts/threads of possible new members, collecting possible vetos, help make sure new members are aware of the rules via the website, providing individuals with invite links. Be available to mediate disagreements with decisions that happen, and provide final recommendations for how to resolve them.

## Invites

Anyone here may nominate someone for invite by providing their discord handle to the safety team.

*Guidelines:*

by nominating someone for inclusion here, we ask that you validate the following about them. Have had negotiated encounters with them, which went positively.

The safety team will then provide a post on this nominee. Everyone will have a week to possibly veto the nominee for inclusion.

*Guidelines:*

Community members are asked to only veto a nomination if the inclusion of the nominee in the server would cause you to leave.

if no veto happens then the nominee will be provided with an invite link
